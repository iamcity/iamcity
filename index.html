<p>IamCity is a platform that connects people to give attention to those little things that DO make a big impact.</p>
 <br>
<p>Have you ever walked down the street, somewhere in your city, looked around and thought: Yaiks, this is so grose. Who will clean this up? Shall I do it? Nahh... you haven't done it.</p>
<p>Ever had little ideas that you think can make a huge impact, but you haven't done anything with it because it seems impossible to do it on your own?</p>
<p>And what if you are not alone? What if you can reach a whole bunch of people with the same thoughts, with just a few clicks?</p>
 <br>
<p>Our goal is to help empower people and motivate them to just do it. It's actually very simple.</p>
<p>With an open source system, everybody can participate in city developments so that the city becomes yours.</p>
 <br>
<p>Think, inspire en just do it because you ARE the city.</p>
